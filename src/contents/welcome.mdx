Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to have you on board as I share my tech adventures and lessons learned over 5+ years in the programming world. I've had the pleasure of working with different technologies in various startup gigs, each tackling cool problems.

#### Quick Journey Through Workplaces

- **Datapeace AI Technologies:** We dove into the world of AI automation, making things smarter.
- **Manch:** Explored social media in different languages, connecting diverse communities.
- **Vogo:** Made daily commuting a breeze with hassle-free vehicle rentals.
- **Tripguru:** Navigating the travel-tech landscape, exploring tours and experiences.

My main gig is with web tech, using Python and JavaScript. They're like the Batman and Robin of my coding journey.

I am also interested in AR and VR tech and I'm here to share what I discover in the world of Extended Reality (XR).

#### What's Cooking?

In this blog, expect:

- **Tech Learnigs:** Bits of learnings from the tech world.
