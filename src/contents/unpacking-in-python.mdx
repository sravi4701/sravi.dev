> **1. Unpacking a sequence into a separate variables.**

So you have given a sequence(like array, string etc) and you want to extract it’s data into separate variable how will you do that?

This can be achieved with assignment operator, The syntax is very simple
```python
# comma_separated_variables = sequence

# given a data in the form of list

data = ['Ravi', 21, (1996, 12, 5)]

# extract name, age, dob from data

name, age, dob = data

print(name) # Ravi

print(age) # 21

print(dob) # (1996, 12, 5)

# It works with any sequence eg.

s = 'hello'

a, b, _, c, d = s

print(b) # e
```

> **2. Unpacking elements from iterables of arbitrary length**

In this case you want to unpack N elements from an iterables but this time the length of iterables can be more than N. Here we can use Python * expression. To know more about * expression consider [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2921847/what-does-the-star-operator-mean) question on stackoverflow.
```python
grades = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

first, *middle, last = grades

print(first) # 5

print(last) # 9

print(middle) # [6, 7, 8]

# The variable associated with * will always be a list

# We also can't use two * expression like:

first, *middle, *last = grades # this will get an error

# More complex example

data = ('Ravi', 21, (5, 12, 1996))

# We need only name and year from data

name, *_, (*_, year) = data

print(name) # Ravi

print(year) # 1996
```
